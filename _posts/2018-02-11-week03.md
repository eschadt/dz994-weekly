### Wikipedia Contribution 

So sorry, somehow I managed to forget the blog post for this week until now :(

I first attempted to find a Wikipedia article to contribute to by looking at Wikipedia's Community Portal. However, it was rather tedious to read through all the articles and try to find grammar mistakes. There were also a lot of articles asking for more information and reference links. I realized though that I had no knowledge on the majority of the topics in these articles, so I started a new search. Over winter break, I had watched a TV Show called _Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency_. Reading through the article, I finally found something I was able to fix.
