### Phaser Progress Report

As of last week, the group has decided to approach Phaser in two ways. Half of the team will tackle fixing the issues in the Phaser 3 examples. As they are just transitioning over to the new version, a lot of the issues are broken. This is what I am working on. The other half of the team is starting to work on creating a Phaser 3 example.
