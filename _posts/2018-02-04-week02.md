## The Cathedral and the Bazaar

### Software Development

* explain (in your own words) the difference between software development following the cathedral model and software development following the bazaar model; which of the two environments would you be more comfortable

Eric Steven Raymond uses the catherdral and the bazaar as metaphors for two different approaches to software development. The cathedral approach is a metaphor for software development in a big corporation, with a rigid, organized structure. On the other hand, the bazaar is used to represent the open source community. People come together to work on a project not only have the skills to do so, but also because they are personally interested in the project. As a result, there is a rapid exchange of ideas. The work progresses more quickly since the audience using the product may also help debug. When developers lose interest in this case though, there is nothing stopping them from walking away, unlike the cathedral model where there is a higher-up to report to.     

After reading The Cathedral and the Bazaar, I would consider the bazaar the dream environment, and the cathedral reality. Personally, I would love to work on projects soley out of personal interest. However, the standard approach to software development seems to be the cathedral one? Although profitable organizations based on open source exist,      

### Lessons

*  The Cathedral and The Bazaar essay has 19 "lessons"; pick two that you found most interesting, intriguing, telling, or that you simply liked; quote them in your blog and try to explain what they supposed to mean

_#9 Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around_

_#10 If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource._

_#2 Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse)._
__An important trait of the great ones is constructive laziness__
