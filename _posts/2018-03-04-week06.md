### Team Assesment and Plan

#### Strengths and Weaknesses

The entire team is familiar with JavaScript and eager to learn new things. Other strengths include Marcus's experience in game design, Melissa's familiarity with Git, Matthew's technical writing and communication skills, and Gabe's debugging skils.  

Meeting in person might be an issue. Finding a time where everyone is free was a struggle. There may be days when people will have to skype in. I think most of us also don't have a lot of prior background in open source, but this is not necessarily a weakness. Five heads are better than one?  

#### Meeting Times

__Option 1:__ Sundays at 2pm
__Option 2:__ Wednesdays at 6pm

#### Milestones

* Get familiar with Phaser (by creating a mini game with it)
* Compile a list of feasible issues to work on
