## Open Source

Although I know this is not necessarily right, one of the first things my mind jumps to upon hearing "open source" is GitHub. I relate the term "open source" to projects where the source code is freely available to view and edit. By having code be readily available to view, the code can be reviewed by a wider audience. This may reduce the number of bugs in the code. However, monetization can be an issue for open source projects. Since the code can be easily accessed, then it cannot be the product being sold to the public. If this issue is unresolved, then developers may not be able to work full time on the open source project. Everyone has bills to pay, so they might have to reduce their hours to whenever they are free outside of work. As a result, updates on these projects may be much slower. 

## Projects

list names of four open source projects that you regularly use or that influenced you in some way in the past; give brief descriptions for each, explain why you use it and what the alternatives might be (note, the projects do not have to be source code based)

### Scratch



### Musescore

### Git

### Firefox
