### Humanitarianism 

Unfortunately, I don't think any of the open source projects that I am familiar with would fall into this category. For example, Phaser is a game engine. From the examples I have seen so far, it is not directly used to improve the lives or living conditions. Games created with Phaser enriches the lives of others instead. 
Another example is Eclipse. People can choose to use Eclipse to write code that can improve the lives of others. However, this is also an indirect link.  

### Phaser Progress

Our meeting time has been changed to Tuesdays at 6:30. 
When we met last week, we went over some of the Phase examples and found some issues to work on.  

The next step I will be working on individually is to continue tinkering with Phaser and try to get a better grasp of how it works. 

### My Contributions This Week
