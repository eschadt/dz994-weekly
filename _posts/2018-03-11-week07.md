### Open Data Week

#### NYC Open Data Week @ NYU

Run by BUGS, it was really interesting to hear what the panelists had to say about open source, as well as see how people have used open source data. It was a nice reminder that open source is not limited to open source projects on GitHub. Previously, I had also never really given much thought to the legal side of open data. Hearing Dominic Mauro talk made me realize there's a whole set of complicated laws regarding this.  
Something else I found interesting, was when an audience member asked about who to hold accountable for open data. The response was that by keeping the data available to many people, there is bound to be someone who will catch the error. It made me think of the saying "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow". 

#### Data Through Design

This event was an exhibit showcasing different artists' use of open source data. The location was a bit hard to find, and as I decided to go after midterms were over, the place was rather empty. The datasets they chose to work with were all unqiue, ranging from the tree population in New York City to rape and sex crimes. Of the projects, _Slow Down_ by Ellen Oh really caught my eye. It was very easy to understand visually, even before reading the description. It really highlighted the sheer number of traffic accidents that have happened over the past few years.
